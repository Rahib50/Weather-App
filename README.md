# Weather-App

A simple weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app is able to fetch information of the weather in a certain city and display the temperature, humidity, windspeed values alongside an image to describe the weather (clear, mist, rain etc.). A youtube tutorial was followed for this project.

Steps followed in sequence:

1. Downloaded the png images for each weather depiction, search, wind, humidity and search
2. Created the index.html and styles.css with the basic skeleton initialised.
3. Followed the youtube tutorial step by step and looking through the logic used sequentially (also trying things such as changing color values).
4. Deploy it via github Settings --> Pages --> deploy from branch and set file to /(root) and save

Challenges:

1. Needed to be very careful with directory names in string as in inital mistake was made to name the folder "Images" in the html code which made the fetching the images of the weather from "images" folder not possible. Fixed afterwards.

2. Had to get used to some syntax and key words such as "block"

Key Features:

1. Search bar to name the city you want to know weather of.
2. Display temperature in degree celcius with an image to depict weather (clear, clouds, rainy etc.)
3. Show Humidity percentage and Wind speed in km/h
